                            Everything in life should be an investment including
                            your thoughts. You wouldn’t buy a hideous house if
                            you were planning to live in it, would you? Your
                            house is an investment where you intend to stay for
                            a long time at the very least. You deciding to eat
                            that fruit instead of that glass of alcohol is an
                            investment in your health. You dating a reliable
                            person for you instead of a toxic person is an
                            investment in your love life and in your mental
                            health. You choosing to take that walk instead of
                            sitting on your chair all day is an investment in
                            your body and health. You deciding to hang out with
                            an inspiring or at the very least productive group
                            of people is an investment in your social life. And
                            when you think about it, the most time you spend
                            with anything or anybody is with your thoughts. You
                            cannot ever escape it. So why not make it a safe
                            haven instead of a petrifying place where you do
                            everything to escape it — drugs, alcohol, partying,
                            food.

                            Ever thought about how you can change your future by
                            revising your past? It all sounds too
                            quantum-physics-B.S, I know. But how do you even
                            define the past? Something that has already
                            happened. We, however, tend to relive those past
                            experiences in the present moment. And what happens
                            when you re-live the past by playing it over and
                            over again in your head? Your past then becomes your
                            present, which in turn becomes the future. Neville
                            Goddard, in one of his books, talked about the
                            Revision method whereby before you go to sleep, in a
                            drowsy state, which is the theta state, you replay
                            the scenes in your head that you didn’t like that
                            happened throughout the day very vividly, and alter
                            it to something positive. Someone said something you
                            didn’t like? Change it to something that you did
                            like. Someone pissed you off? Change it to you being
                            happy and blissful.

                            Whether it be work related problems or finances
                            turmoil, most of us get stressed out every now and
                            then. But what kind of impact does taking stress
                            cause in terms of our health? Every time we stress,
                            we raise our cortisol levels, also known as, “the
                            stress hormone”, which causes inflammation in our
                            body. In an article published by Science Daily, it
                            has been shown that excessive cortisol levels can
                            have irreversible impact on our health and body,
                            resulting in ineffectual brain capacity in
                            individuals. According to the American Institute Of
                            Stress, those who have chronic stress in their lives
                            tend to have higher chances of getting stroke, heart
                            diseases and overall declination of physical health.
                            The review paper done by Montreal de University
                            found out that when a pregnant woman takes
                            psychological stress, also known as prenatal stress,
                            the child after birth has lower birthweight and
                            lower size as well as disturbances in both
                            neurological and cognitive aspects.

                            Remember, a long, long time ago, when we didn't have
                            any tabloids, any internet — actually, go back even
                            further. To a time when we were incredibly barbaric,
                            essentially just animals. We couldn't speak properly
                            and barely had any clothes on. During this time, our
                            Lizard Brain was the dominant force inside our
                            heads. It was all about seeking the most amount of
                            pleasure and avoiding any form of pain. It meant
                            seeing a fruit fall from a tree and instantly eating
                            it without any second thought. It meant killing
                            animals without feeling any remorse for the sake of
                            food and survival. It was about having sex with as
                            many people as possible to procreate and spread your
                            DNA. It was about killing others if necessary to
                            ensure your own survival. It was about being greedy
                            and hoarding resources where only you could access
                            them to ensure you didn't starve. It's basically
                            about seeking the most pleasure in the present
                            moment and avoiding any form of pain — that's the
                            Lizard Brain. Humans have evolved in a beautiful
                            way, not just physically. Our feet, once considered
                            icky, now appear symmetrical and even attractive.
                            But it's not just our appearance that has changed;
                            our brains have also undergone significant
                            alterations.

                            Everybody loves to play the victim, and I know you
                            have done it at some point too. I know that you've
                            felt like everyone is against you, that you're
                            constantly being played, and that you're all alone
                            in this world. Perhaps you've believed that everyone
                            around you is a narcissist, and you're just unlucky
                            in relationships, friendships, and your career,
                            leaving you feeling unlucky in life in general. But
                            how true is that narrative, really? As you can
                            already tell from the title, you are not a victim,
                            and you are not unlucky. Your approach to life and
                            your beliefs about yourself and the world shape your
                            reality. The patterns in your life are influenced by
                            the thoughts you entertain every day. What kind of
                            thoughts are you feeding yourself? Is it “Everybody
                            sucks,” “I'm destined to be alone,” or “Why does
                            this keep happening to me?”

                            Most of us refrain from starting something we truly
                            desire due to fear. Imagine setting out to climb a
                            mountain with your focus solely on reaching the
                            summit. In this mindset, every path leading to the
                            mountain feels burdensome, as your mind is fixated
                            on the destination. The journey becomes a source of
                            resentment, overshadowed by the obsession to reach
                            the top. When you finally do reach the summit after
                            enduring struggles, the joy you anticipated is often
                            lackluster. Now, consider a different scenario where
                            you enjoy every moment of the journey towards the
                            peak. You find pleasure in walking for hours,
                            embracing the cold, and conquering uphill terrain,
                            knowing each step leads you closer to your goal. If
                            you aim to shed 20 kilograms from your body,
                            focusing solely on the end result might make the
                            journey seem endless. However, by cherishing the
                            process and celebrating your daily progress, you'll
                            effortlessly reach your goal. Looking back, you'll
                            find it exhilarating to see how far you've come, not
                            even realizing when or how you achieved your target
                            because you were wholeheartedly engrossed in the
                            journey itself.

                            What were the times when you've felt separated from
                            the ego or didn't identify with it? All those people
                            who made you feel bad do not matter anymore, and
                            time doesn't seem to exist. You lose yourself in a
                            state that feels heavenly, as if your ego doesn't
                            even exist. The feeling is pure, gratifying, and
                            beautiful. Now, this is an orgasm worth feeling
                            because it keeps on giving. You lose track of time
                            and forget everything else except what's in front of
                            you. You don't think about that one acne that's been
                            sitting on your face. You don't care about your
                            partner not texting you as much lately. You don't
                            think about yourself for once and just focus on the
                            task at hand. You aren't self-absorbed, and it's an
                            amazing feeling. You wish to feel this way forever,
                            but unfortunately, you've only felt it in glimpses.
                            But it's a great feeling, so of course, you remember
                            it. It's called the flow state where you get the
                            ultimate mental orgasm, but it's the mentalgasm that
                            keeps on giving rather than draining you. It makes
                            you feel alive, lose track of time, yourself. You
                            completely forget about yourself, and ironically,
                            it’s a beautiful feeling. Forgetting your body, your
                            face, your insecurities, and your problems. It takes
                            you to a different place, and you wish to be there
                            for a long time.

                            Most of us love delaying things that will make our
                            lives better in the long run, don’t we? We don’t
                            necessarily love procrastination, but we often give
                            in to it. The thought of having some chips and
                            watching another episode of Friends can be
                            incredibly tempting and comfortable. Despite knowing
                            that we should be doing something productive, we
                            give into the ease of the moment. We delay the
                            things that are good for us. Why? Because of the
                            devil — resistance, and so we prefer to do something
                            else. Is there a way out of this hellish hole? Yes.

                            So you finished your tasks on your main list
                            yesterday? Great! That's what I'm talking about and
                            you should feel proud of yourself. Despite the
                            resistance, you managed to do it anyway! Here's the
                            thing, though. While you should take a moment or two
                            to feel good and proud of yourself for successfully
                            completing your tasks, no matter the obstacles you
                            encountered, it's crucial to remind yourself each
                            new day that your slate is wiped clean. Your day
                            resets every day. So, in a way, what you
                            accomplished yesterday doesn't carry over or hold as
                            much significance. What matters is what you
                            accomplish today. Certainly, celebrate your
                            victories after finishing your tasks daily, whether
                            by giving yourself a pat on the back or any other
                            form of celebration you prefer. However, this
                            celebration shouldn't transform into an excuse to
                            skip tasks the following day, as that's a slippery
                            slope back into old habits.

                            Great things take time to come to fruition. When you
                            plant a seed in the ground, it requires time before
                            you witness the fruit. It doesn't occur overnight,
                            nor does it manifest within a few days. Patience is
                            essential as you water it and provide ample
                            sunlight. During the initial phase, you might see
                            nothing but soil. Deep down, you know that with
                            consistent watering and proper sunlight, a beautiful
                            flower or a bountiful fruit will emerge. Now,
                            consider what would happen if you dug your fingers
                            into the soil out of frustration, unable to see
                            anything beyond the mud. In doing so, you would
                            obstruct the growth of the flower or fruit. It
                            simply won't materialize. You must come to terms
                            with the fact that in the beginning, you won't
                            witness progress — just the brown mud. By exercising
                            patience, you will eventually witness growth.
                            Similarly, if you continually gaze at the mud
                            multiple times a day, hoping to discern growth and
                            becoming frustrated when you don't, you're only
                            causing yourself harm.

                            anything over being bored. We socialize with
                            friends, indulge in food and drinks, watch new
                            series — anything to alleviate that sense of
                            boredom. At times, we romanticize our past to feel
                            something, or we fantasize about the future just to
                            experience fear or anxiety. Each of us has different
                            hobbies, backgrounds, and passions. Some are dog
                            people, while others are cat people. However, we can
                            all agree that we truly abhor the feeling of
                            boredom. We resort to anything to escape it.
                            Sometimes, our efforts lean towards less destructive
                            hedonistic activities, while other times, they
                            involve very destructive behaviors like drugs,
                            infidelity, and even committing crimes.

                            We often believe that happiness will only come when
                            we accumulate a considerable amount of wealth,
                            achieve success, and acquire all the possessions we
                            desire. The idea is that once we have amassed
                            significant resources, we can finally spend the rest
                            of our lives indulging in constant leisure and spend
                            our days in perpetual vacation mode. It does sound
                            like an idyllic scenario, doesn't it? However, is
                            this perception really the truth? I'm here to tell
                            you that adopting such a mindset is not the right
                            way to go. Engaging in pleasurable activities isn't
                            inherently wrong, but if your life's purpose
                            revolves around working, grinding, and then
                            indulging in hedonistic pursuits day in and day out,
                            then your perspective might need some adjustment.
                            Let me elaborate.

                            Everyone has experienced pain. While some of us try
                            to avoid it, others manage to move beyond it. Then
                            there are those who spend their entire lives trying
                            to escape from pain, doing everything possible to
                            distance themselves from it. The lizard brain, in
                            particular, is driven to steer clear of pain. It
                            fails to recognize that certain types of pain are
                            actually beneficial and contribute to personal
                            growth. On top of that, It lacks an understanding of
                            delayed gratification. Due to the persistence of the
                            lizard brain in our evolutionary history, many of us
                            give in to its primitive impulses, striving to
                            minimize encounters with pain. As discussed in the
                            previous chapter, the lizard brain is driven solely
                            by the pursuit of instant gratification and
                            pleasurable experiences. Because most of us are
                            influenced by our emotional responses, which
                            originate from the lizard brain, we tend to avoid
                            subjecting ourselves to discomfort. The lizard brain
                            fails to comprehend that enduring certain pains can
                            ultimately lead to the most pleasurable moments in
                            the future. Its primary objective is to avoid
                            immediate pain and seek immediate pleasure.

                            No, it isn’t about the lessons you probably forgot
                            in your Chemistry subject in school. It’s more about
                            your brain chemistry. After all, it controls almost
                            all aspects of your life. All the things you do,
                            they’re influenced by certain chemicals. For
                            example, you love playing Fortnite. When asked why,
                            what would your answer be? “I just love it” or “It
                            makes me happy.” When asked why you’re dating a
                            particular person, what would your answer be?
                            “He/She makes me happy” or “We make each other
                            happy.” “We just have that chemistry” or something
                            similar. When asked why you love a particular food,
                            you might say, “I just love the taste. It has the
                            perfect combination of salt and sweet” or “It brings
                            me nostalgia. Takes me back to my childhood” or
                            something similar. When asked why you love a certain
                            place, you might respond with, “It brings me
                            nostalgia,” “It’s peaceful,” “I love the lights,”
                            and so forth. But if you go deeper, certain
                            chemicals fire up in your brain — the feel-good
                            brain chemicals like dopamine, as talked about
                            earlier, endorphins, serotonin, and oxytocin.
